# Frequently Asked Questions

## WHO ARE YOU?

We are the Glasgow Student Housing Co-operative! We formed in November 2016, and have been operating as a business since March 2017. We are all full-time students of various universities/colleges in Glasgow. All of the members are also directors of the co-op. We collectively decide how to run the co-op. There is no board, or “person in charge”, we operate in a completely non-hierarchical way.

## WHAT IS A CO-OPERATIVE?

A co-operative is an organisation or business that is owned and controlled by its members. There are many different types of co-ops, including housing co-ops, workers’ co-ops, food, arts, architecture, media, etc. They are all characterised by being run and managed by their members, usually in a non-hierarchical and consensus-led manner.

## WHAT DO YOU DO?

Our co-op works to provide students of Glasgow with cooperatively managed housing that meets their needs, and fosters healthy, sustainable communities for all. Since 2016, we have been figuring out how to secure enough funding to house our members. Now that funding is almost in place, we are keeping an eye out for a potential future home!

We have (almost) weekly general meetings to discuss our progress and tasks that ensure the upkeep of the co-op (also called governance).

Our members also like to meet more socially, for dinner at one of our flats, or for drinks!

## DO YOU HAVE A HOUSE? CAN I MOVE IN?

We do not have a house yet. We have worked to secure funding though, so we will be housed in the coming months! To move in, you will need to follow our application process which would include becoming a member/director of the co-operative. 

## DO I HAVE TO BE A STUDENT TO GET INVOLVED?

Yes, you do have to be a full or part-time student over 18. Being a student, prospective student or recent graduate (less than a year) is a condition of membership and living in the co-op once we are housed. However, we are always looking for people who are interested and willing to give some of their time to the co-op, even if they aren’t students – so please don’t hesitate to contact us if you want to do so!

## CAN YOU HELP ME FIND HOUSING?

Unfortunately we won’t actively be able to help you find housing, as that isn’t the purpose of the co-op. We also aren’t housing experts, however we do have some information and resources we can recommend. Here are some pages you can try. 

For students at the University of Glasgow: SRC advice on accommodation, UoG accommodation services.

For other students: Spareroom.

Read advice from Shelter, Student Information Scotland and your university on how to avoid scams and bad landlords/estate agents.

## IS YOUR CO-OP DISABILITY FRIENDLY?

We strive to be. We try to hold our meetings in places that aren’t overly loud or stimulating, as well as in places that are warm and dry, and accessible for wheelchair users (including bathrooms). We want to look after our members and their wellbeing, so we actively try to review the impact of running the co-op on our lives as students and as people more generally. We always do whatever we can to avoid burnout. 

Similarly, when housed, we want to ensure at least one of the bedrooms and bathrooms is fully accessible to anyone with a physical disability or restricted mobility. This also includes steps into/out of the property or garden, etc. We are at the mercy of the properties on the market that are affordable though, but even if to start with the co-op house isn’t disability friendly, we may be able to reinvest some rental income into making the necessary changes.

## CAN I INTERVIEW YOUR MEMBERS FOR RESEARCH ON HOUSING/CO-OPERATIVES?

It depends on our individual member’s availability, but we’re usually more than happy to talk about the co-op and the co-operative movement with anyone who will listen. We recommend coming to a meeting and observing and taking part as a good starting point to get to know us and our work. 

## CAN YOU ADVERTISE MY EVENT?

If it’s about co-ops or student living, or anything that fits in with our values and mission, we will happily give it a look and might share it with our members.
