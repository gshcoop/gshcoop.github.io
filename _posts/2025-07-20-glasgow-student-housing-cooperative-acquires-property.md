Scotmid Co-operative has contributed a total of £300,000 in loan and share capital investment in Student Co-op Homes to support the purchase of a traditional flatted property in South West Glasgow--securing the first home for the Glasgow Student Housing Co-operative (GSHC). The property will be tenanted by students and run democratically by its residents, offering a fair, community-led alternative to soaring private rents. 

This milestone deal coincides with the International Year of Co-operatives 2025, a global celebration of how co-operatives offer long-term, values-led responses to social challenges such as the housing crisis. 

Craig Strachan, CFO of Scotmid, said: "We’re delighted to support Student Co-op Homes and help bring the Glasgow Student Housing Co-op’s vision to life. This investment reflects our belief in long- term, values-driven partnerships--and in the ability of young people to lead meaningful change through the co-operative model." 

Scott Jennings, Chair of Student Co-op Homes, said: "Scotmid’s support is a game-changer. It not only helps secure our first property in Glasgow but also sets an inspiring example of how established co-ops can empower new ones. This is Principle 6 in action--strengthening the co-operative ecosystem from the ground up."

May Armstrong, Secretary of Glasgow Student Housing Co-op, said: "This investment means everything to us. For years we’ve been working toward a student housing model that’s affordable, sustainable, and rooted in community. Now we finally have a home we can manage ourselves -- and the chance to show what co-operation can achieve."

Student Co-op Homes, the UK’s national body for student housing co-ops, already supports over 130 students living in propertied co-ops in Birmingham, Edinburgh, and Brighton. The Glasgow development marks an exciting expansion into Scotland’s largest student city.

This is the start of something bigger. With demand for decent, affordable housing at an all-time high, this project demonstrates how students can lead the way--building more homes, run by students for students, where rents are fair and quality is prioritised.

The project has been made possible through a wide network of support, which has included:
- Edinburgh Student Housing Co-op has lent funds to cover initial running and core costs.
- Co-operate Scotland provided ongoing support to GSHC throughout the process.
- Leading law firm Shepherd and Wedderburn offered pro bono conveyancing and regulatory advice, having been connected to the project through TrustLaw, the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s global pro bono legal network.

As the world celebrates the International Year of Co-operatives, this collaboration between Scotmid, Student Co-op Homes and GSHC shows the movement’s potential to innovate--creating student-led housing rooted in fairness, community, and the power of co-operation.
