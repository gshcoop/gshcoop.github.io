We are Glasgow’s first student housing cooperative, gearing up to house 5 students following [our recent property acquisition]({% post_url 2025-07-20-glasgow-student-housing-cooperative-acquires-property %}). We welcome students who are at university, college and in modern apprenticeships.

We believe that a housing co-op is an effective way to combat increasing rent prices, and provide a democratically controlled living environment. Collectively, members of a co-op take on the role of landlord and have a direct say in their living conditions.

There are many different kinds of co-ops: housing, food, consumer, worker-owned… but generally, all co-operatives follow the [Rochdale Principles](https://seedsforchange.org.uk/coop-principles).

We are members of Student Co-op Homes, an umbrella organisation for student housing co-ops in the UK. You can find out more about student housing co-operatives who already own a building (like in Edinburgh, Birmingham, Nottingham and Sheffield), and how to start your own on their website.
