title: About Us
---

We are a group of university students setting up the first student housing co-op in Glasgow. We were formed in November 2016, and have recently secured funding to manage our first property, owned on our behalf by Student Co-operative Homes. We welcome students who are at university, college and in apprenticeships.

We believe that a housing co-op is an effective way to combat increasing rent prices, and provide a democratically controlled living environment. Collectively, members of a co-op take on the role of landlord and have a direct say in their living conditions.

There are many different kinds of co-ops: housing, food, consumer, worker-owned… but generally, all co-operatives follow the [Rochdale Principles](https://seedsforchange.org.uk/coop-principles).
