# Governance
## (The nitty-gritty stuff)

We want to be transparent with our governance, and be a model co-operative for others to learn from. Here you can find our rulebook, amendments, policies and minutes of Annual General Meetings (names may be redacted), publicly available to all as of 2025. This page also acts to serve our members as the location where they can find the most up-to-date versions of our policies as needed.

### Our Rulebook
We’ve adopted the RRFM14 model rules created by [Radical Routes](https://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/landing-page/). [Catalyst Collective](https://www.catalystcollective.org/home/housing-co-op-registration/rrfm14/) sponsored our registration with this rulebook in 2017.

You can find the latest version of our rulebook on the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority)’s Mutuals Public Register: <https://mutuals.fca.org.uk/Search/Society/8265>.

### Our Policy
We’re currently reviewing our policy as we gear up to accept and house 3 new members, following our recent property acquisition. We will strive to update this page as soon as possible.

### Minutes
There are currently no minutes to post.
